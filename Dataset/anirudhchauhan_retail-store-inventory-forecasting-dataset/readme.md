# About Dataset
This dataset provides **synthetic** yet realistic data for analyzing and forecasting retail store inventory demand. It contains over 73000 rows of daily data across multiple stores and products, including attributes like sales, inventory levels, pricing, weather, promotions, and holidays.

The dataset is ideal for practicing machine learning tasks such as demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, and inventory optimization. It allows data scientists to explore time series forecasting techniques, study the impact of external factors like weather and holidays on sales, and build advanced models to optimize supply chain performance.

## Challenges for Data Scientists:
#### Challenge 1: Time Series Demand Forecasting
Predict daily product demand across stores using historical sales and inventory data. Can you build an LSTM-based forecasting model that outperforms classical methods like ARIMA?

#### Challenge 2: Inventory Optimization
Optimize inventory levels by analyzing sales trends and minimizing stockouts while reducing overstock situations.

#### Challenge 3: Dynamic Pricing
Develop a pricing strategy based on demand, competitor pricing, and discounts to maximize revenue.

## Key Data Features:
Date: Daily records from [start_date] to [end_date].
Store ID & Product ID: Unique identifiers for stores and products.
Category: Product categories like Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, etc.
Region: Geographic region of the store.
Inventory Level: Stock available at the beginning of the day.
Units Sold: Units sold during the day.
Demand Forecast: Predicted demand based on past trends.
Weather Condition: Daily weather impacting sales.

## Example Notebook Ideas
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze sales trends, visualize data, and identify patterns.
Time Series Forecasting: Train models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM to predict future demand.
Pricing Analysis: Study how discounts and competitor pricing affect sales.
